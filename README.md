# WifiFlicker_Wordclock

This Arduino code creates a "Word Clock" using a WifiFlicker board (bascially
an ESP8266 module with a 5V level shifter), an array of 144 NeoPixels, and a
RTC module

It implements a web server to change the time and behavior of the clock. It
uses the WiFiManager library to connect to a Wifi network.
